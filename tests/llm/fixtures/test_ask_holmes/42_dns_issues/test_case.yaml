  The answer should show the the investigation roughly went through the following steps.
  - Check CoreDNS/kube-dns Pods
  - Examine DNS Service
  - Test DNS Resolution from a Pod
  - Check NetworkPolicies
  - Review CoreDNS Configuration (if applicable)
  - Check the DNS trace

  Not all these need to match exactly and they don't need to be all present.
